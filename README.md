National Nutrtion Program (NNP) Data  ETL process
This Python script implements a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes data files stored in a local directory (D:/NNP/ETL/). It begins by extracting data from three types of files — CSV, JSON, and XML — using custom functions designed for each format. The extracted data includes fields related to Vitamin A supplementation (VitA, firstDose, and secondDose). During extraction, it reads all matching files except the target output file, ensuring no reprocessing. The XML extraction includes parsing elements, but contains a small typo (firstDode instead of firstDose) that could cause a runtime error.

Once data is extracted, it is passed through a transformation phase where only the firstDose values are recalculated by applying a 0.11 factor and rounding to two decimal places. The transformed data is then saved as a CSV file (transformed_data.csv) in the same directory. Throughout the process, a logging function writes time-stamped messages to a log file, tracking each phase of the ETL process (Start, Extract, Transform, Load, and End), which is useful for monitoring and debugging purposes.
